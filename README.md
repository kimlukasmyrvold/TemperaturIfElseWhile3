# TemperatureIfElseWhile
School project for reading input from user via console and then writing text console depending on users input

The program works by asking user to input a temperature in form of a number, then it will output that the temperature is positive, zero or a negative number. If the user does not input a number the program will notify the user and ask again for a number, this will loop forever until the user inputs a number.
